<h2> My Top 3 Movies Of all-time. </h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Mankatha</h3>
<p>Mankatha is a racy movie with many twists that keeps everyone glued to the screen till the end of the film.</p>
<h3>Mersal</h3>
<p>It has screenplay written for convenience. It tries to tap into superficial elements as they are low hanging fruits and wins maximum audiences.</p>
<h3>VIP</h3>
<p>The story was really interesting but there were parts that seemed too slow (scenes without action).</p>
